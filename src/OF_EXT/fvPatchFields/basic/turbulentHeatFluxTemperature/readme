Modified version of compressible:turbulentHeatFlux boundary condition, for incompressible flows which is compatible with OF5 and OF6.

To use this boundary condition you need to modify the constant/transport file by adding the following:



Pr	Pr[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] yourvaluehere;

Prt	Prt[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] yourvaluehere;

rhoCp0 yourvaluehere;

where, rhoCp0 is the value of density*specific heat capacity [kg/m^3][J/Kg/K]


example:

Pr	Pr[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 7;

Prt	Prt[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 0.71;

rhoCp0 4210000;



To tell OF that there is a new boundary condition, you need to add in system/controldict the following line:

libs ("turbulentHeatFluxTemperature.so");
