0.1mx01m cavity (50 cells per direction)

parametric variation of
-kinematic viscosity nu
-total fraction delayed neutrons  betaTot (with betai/betaTot=const)
-3rd decay heat group decay constant decLam3

Parameters are varied from 0.9 to 1.1 the reference values nu0,betaTot0, decLam30.

Re=100 (computed with nu0)

Temperature has 4 Dirichlet boundaries, thus 4 lift-functions

offline stage: 31 runs, 150 s each, 0.1 s timestep, snapshots saved every 5 s. (ITHACAdict file)

Sensitivity Analysis:

two figures of merit are considered,
P_tot (total power)
T_m    (average temperature) 
both at t=100 s
