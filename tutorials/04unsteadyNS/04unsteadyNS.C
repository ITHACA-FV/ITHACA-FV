/// \brief Implementation of tutorial 4 for an unsteady Navier-Stokes problem

/// \example 04unsteadyNS.C
/// \section intro_unsreadyNS Introduction to tutorial 4
/// In this tutorial we implement a parametrized unsteady Navier-Stokes 2D problem where the parameter is the kinematic viscosity.
/// The physical problem represents an incompressible flow passing around a very long cylinder. The simulation domain is rectangular
/// with spatial bounds of [-4, 30], and [-5, 5] in the X and Y directions, respectively. The cylinder has a radius of
/// 0.5 unit length and is located at the origin. The system has a prescribed uniform inlet velocity of 1 m/s which is constant through the whole simulation.
///
/// The following image illustrates the simulated system at time = 50 s and Re = 100.
/// \image html cylinder.png
///
/// \section code04 A detailed look into the code
///
/// In this section we explain the main steps necessary to construct the tutorial N°4
///
/// \subsection header ITHACA-FV header files
///
/// First of all let's have a look at the header files that need to be included and what they are responsible for.
///
/// The header files of ITHACA-FV necessary for this tutorial are: <unsteadyNS.H> for the full order unsteady NS problem,
/// <ITHACAPOD.H> for the POD decomposition, <reducedUnsteadyNS.H> for the construction of the reduced order problem,
/// and finally <ITHACAstream.H> for some ITHACA input-output operations.
///
/// \dontinclude 04unsteadyNS.C
/// \skip unsteadyNS
/// \until ITHACAstream
///
/// \subsection classtutorial04 Definition of the tutorial04 class
///
/// We define the tutorial04 class as a child of the unsteadyNS class.
/// The constructor is defined with members that are the fields need to be manipulated
/// during the resolution of the full order problem using pimpleFoam. Such fields are
/// also initialized with the same initial conditions in the solver.
/// \skipline tutorial04
/// \until {}
///
/// Inside the tutorial04 class we define the offlineSolve method according to the
/// specific parametrized problem that needs to be solved. If the offline solve has
/// been previously performed then the method just reads the existing snapshots from the Offline directory.
/// Otherwise it loops over all the parameters, changes the system viscosity with the iterable parameter
/// then performs the offline solve.
///
/// \skipline offlineSolve
/// \until }
/// \skipline else
/// \until }
/// \skipline }
/// \skipline }
///
/// We note that in the commented line we show that it is possible to parametrize the boundary conditions.
/// For further details we refer to the classes: reductionProblem, and unsteadyNS.
///
/// \subsection main Definition of the main function
///
/// In this section we show the definition of the main function.
/// First we construct the object "example" of type tutorial04:
///
/// \skipline example
///
/// Then we parse the ITHACAdict file to determine the number of modes
/// to be written out and also the ones to be used for projection of
/// the velocity, pressure, and the supremizer:
/// \skipline ITHACAparameters
/// \until NmodesSUPproj
///
/// we note that a default value can be assigned in case the parser did
/// not find the corresponding string in the ITHACAdict file.
///
/// Now we would like to perform 10 parametrized simulations where the kinematic viscosity
/// is the sole parameter to change, and it lies in the range of {0.1, 0.01} m^2/s equispaced.
/// Alternatively, we can also think of those simulations as that they are performed for fluid
/// flow that has Re changes from Re=10 to Re=100 with step size = 10. In fact, both definitions
/// are the same since the inlet velocity and the domain geometry are both kept fixed through all
/// simulations.
///
/// In our implementation, the parameter (viscosity) can be defined by specifying that
/// Nparameters=1, Nsamples=10, and the parameter ranges from 0.1 to 0.01 equispaced, i.e.
///
/// \skipline example.Pnumber
/// \until example.genEquiPar()
///
/// After that we set the inlet boundaries where we have the non homogeneous BC:
///
/// \skipline example.inlet
/// \until example.inletIndex(0, 1) = 0;
///
/// And we set the parameters for the time integration, so as to simulate 20 seconds for each
/// simulation, with a step size = 0.01 seconds, and the data are dumped every 1.0 seconds, i.e.
///
/// \skipline example.startTime
/// \until example.writeEvery
///
/// Now we are ready to perform the offline stage:
///
/// \skipline Solve()
///
/// and to solve the supremizer problem:
///
/// \skipline supremizer()
///
/// In order to search and compute the lifting function (which should be a step function of value
/// equals to the unitary inlet velocity), we perform the following:
///
/// \skipline liftSolve()
///
/// Then we create homogenuous basis functions for the velocity:
///
/// \skipline computeLift
///
/// After that, the modes for velocity, pressure and supremizers are obtained:
///
/// \skipline getModes
/// \until supfield
///
/// then the projection onto the POD modes is performed with:
///
/// \skipline projectSUP
///
/// Now that we obtained all the necessary information from the POD decomposition and the reduced matrices,
/// we are now ready to construct the dynamical system for the reduced order model (ROM). We proceed
/// by constructing the object "reduced" of type reducedUnsteadyNS:
///
/// \skipline reducedUnsteadyNS
///
/// And then we can use the new constructed ROM to perform the online procedure, from which we can simulate the
/// problem at new set of parameters. For instance, we solve the problem with a viscosity=0.055 for a 15
/// seconds of physical time:
///
/// \skipline reduced.nu
/// \until reduced.dt
///
/// and then the online solve is performed. In this tutorial, the value of the online velocity
/// is in fact a multiplication factor of the step lifting function for the unitary inlet velocity.
/// Therefore the online velocity sets the new BC at the inlet, hence we solve the ROM at new BC.
///
/// \skipline Eigen::
/// \until solveOnline_sup
///
/// Finally the ROM solution is reconstructed and exported:
///
/// \skipline reconstruct_sup
///
/// We note that all the previous evaluations of the pressure were based on the supremizers approach.
/// We can also use the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE) instead of SUP so as to be implemented for the
/// projections, the online solve, and the fields reconstructions.
///
